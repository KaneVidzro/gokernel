# GoKernel

A containerized Go-based platform with REST API, gRPC, PostgreSQL, Redis, and Nginx reverse proxy with automated TLS certificates via Let‚Äôs Encrypt.

## üöÄ Features

- REST API (`/`) served over HTTPS
- Native gRPC (`/grpc`) and gRPC-Web (`/grpc-web`) support
- PostgreSQL + Redis integration
- Dockerized environment with `docker compose`
- Automatic TLS certificates via **Certbot + Nginx**
- Developer-friendly **Makefile** for builds, migrations, and quality checks

---

## üì¶ Requirements

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
- [Go 1.22+](https://go.dev/dl/) (for local builds/tests)
- [protoc](https://grpc.io/docs/protoc-installation/) (for regenerating gRPC stubs)
- [golangci-lint](https://golangci-lint.run/) (for linting)

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup

1. **Clone the repo**

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/kanevidzro/gokernel.git
   ```

2. **Copy `.env.example` to `.env`**

   ```sh
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

3. **Build and start the services**
   ```sh
   make up
   ```
4. **Access the API**

   ```sh
   API ‚Üí https://api.example.com/
   gRPC ‚Üí https://api.example.com/grpc
   gRPC-Web ‚Üí https://api.example.com/grpc-web
   ```

   **Note:** The API and gRPC endpoints are served over HTTPS, so you‚Äôll need to accept the certificate in your browser.
